- Beautifully display text / video
- Add comments page

- On new load, sometimes asyncstorage doesn't have data/doesn't finish fetching and thus the program hangs on spinning circle

- Make fetch for json object (make fetch more robust for other sites)

- Sort content by date or relevance

- Make toast more reliable and faster

- Fix npm audit vulnerabilities (can't upgrade because react, react-native, expo and sdk-version need to be aligned)
